    Its a program that use linear regression algoritm of machine learning to autotune your screen bright
in term of changing your screen from dark to light theame and vise-verse.

    After download you will have better using experiance if you add program to startup folder.
For that press "win+r" and enter one of commands:
    "shell:startup" if you want to autorun only from your user.
    or
    "shell:common startup" if you want to autorun from every user.
    press enter and in opened folder just copy your moni-tune shortcut. Thats all.

    To control there are three hotkeys:

        PAUSE - "ctrl+alt+c"
        UNPAUSE - "ctrl+alt+v"
        CLOSE - "ctrl+alt+x"
        CHANGE SETTING = "ctrl+alt+z"

    Moni-tune remember your last 30 actions of changing your screen bright and the screens at that moment and 
depends on this information learn what screen bright you need for this screen.

    SETIING:

Also you can change some setting. 
    You can enter number of saved screen which means the more number the more accuracy
program predict brithness value but worse adapting to the change. 
    And you can enter diviation value. It depending to the value stay more or less 
sensitive to the screen changing.

    FILES:

    After first start app create two files. The first one is "app_setting.json" and its a setting of program.
The second is "bright_recog_reg_model.pkl" and its a saved state of machine learning module that uses for prediction.


        ENJOY AND SEE YOU LATER :)
